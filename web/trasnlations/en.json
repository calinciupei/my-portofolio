  "I18N.MORE.EXTROVERT": "<h2>You are more of an extrovert </h2><p>Whether at work or at home, you are a leader, the head of the pack. You are the type of person who is at ease with everyone — with the grocer, the doctor, a managing director or a waiter. You have an opinion about just about everything and you like to share your knowledge around, even imposing it on others if they haven’t asked for it. Your personal and professional entourages easily class you as a ‘loud mouth’, sure about yourself, not in the least bit bothered about what others think of you and someone who occasionally likes to play the card of provocation. When you’re on a roll, it’s hard to sop you and the least that could be said is that listening skills are not one of your innate skills. In the couples arena, you have maybe fallen for someone with a similar temperament – making for animated evenings! Or on the contrary, you live with a more introverted partner over whom you can, in some cases, have the upper hand. Your confidence and exuberance are a strong motor for your highly colorful life and you are a real antidote to any hint of grey skies or boredom. It’s perhaps the moments of excess activity or confidence that you need to question. Your capacity to be over the top can make others feel that you consider yourself as the most important person, that you have to be the centre of attention to feel loved and thus to exist, unless of course these are ways of pre-empting judgement from others. Do you worry about leaving others indifferent if you’re not perpetually ‘on show’? Maybe this need for attention is to compensate your own self-judgement? Your energy levels and enthusiasm are unquestionable, but are you as comfortable receiving as giving? Have you actually listened to anyone recently, without butting in? Do you know how to stay by yourself and do nothing else but be with yourself? A few questions that could be interesting to ask yourself…</p>",
  "I18N.MORE.INTROVERT": "<h2>You are more of a public introvert and private extrovert</h2><p>Within your circle of family and friends, you are completely at ease and it’s often you who takes the lead to organise outings, dinners, vacations, etc. However, as soon as you are in a public or professional setting you become rather inhibited. You don’t feel in tune with what you would qualify as agitation, rivalry or vainglory and this can sometimes appear to others as a kind of hidden criticism or a lack of ambition. In fact, your pragmatic temperament helps you successfully manage problems as and when they arise. You aren’t the kind to calculate your every move and plan every inch of your life, and you find the sphere of family and friends to be much more gratifying to the professional sphere. You are more expressive in emotional, sensorial and human terms and at home your organisation skills and capacity to oil the family wheels work well and many of your family and friends appreciate your qualities and skills. At first glance, people find it hard to understand how you could be so comfortable organising your private life and then seem to lose the better part of your self-confidence when you’re in public. Maybe it’s a question of rhythm? If you feel comfortable in your domestic rhythm it’s perhaps because it works more on a short-term basis (day, week or more rarely a month). On the contrary, the rhythm of professional life seems less concrete and more distant as the professional agenda works more to quarterly or annual plans, that you have no control over. Is this the source of your lessened motivation? You can’t control all the cards so you have to adapt and, in fact, that doesn’t interest you at all? If this difference between work and home life doesn’t bother you, then carry on. However, if you feel frustrated by this imbalance, it could be useful to look into the deeper reasons (either on your own or with someone else) that keep you less focused on professional ambition. For instance, such reasons could be: a lack of thanks and recognition, a fear of not being up to the mark… It’s up to you to find out.</p>"
